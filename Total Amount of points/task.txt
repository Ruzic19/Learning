Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match looks like 'x:y'. Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example : [ '3:1', '2:2', '0:1', ... ]


Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match :

- if x>y -3 points
- if x<y - 0 points
- if x=y - 1 points
